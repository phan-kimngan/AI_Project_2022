#  AI PROJECT 2022
## Task: Combining Video Class Solution with Face Recognition Solution
Name: Kim Ngan Ngan

### Set up environment
+ Create a python new_env environment using conda or other tools.

+ Instead packages in requirements.txt
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
+ Activate new_env environment
```bash
conda activate new_env
```
### How to use?

You create a directory named **data** that contains the **inputs** and **outputs** sub-folders. The **input** sub-folder contains mp4 files for video recording. That means you must select the mp4 file when the system runs the recognition based on the video recording. The **outputs** sub-folder contains mp4 result files for both video recording and webcam.
